# gist-search
A simple javascript application to search and view public Gists of users.


## Problem Statement

Github Gist Listing APP

### Goals

The goal of this technical test is to evaluate ability in relevant competence areas

These include:
- Ability to use Javascript MVC frameworks to interact with APIs
- Competence with creation and implementation of basic designs
- Clean, readable and performant code

### Details

Use the Github Gist API, to create a single-page app with a Javascript framework of your choice (vue.js/react preferred).

- List: On entering a github username, it should be able to fetch a full list of public gists by that user.
- Filetype: Convert the filetypes of the files in the gist into a tag/badge, (e.g, if the returned gist
has list of files containing python and javascript files, the gist should have the respective
tags/badges).
- Forks: Username/Avatar of of the last 3 users who forked it with avatar linking to the fork.

If time is the constraint itâ€™s preferable to mention the potential improvements.
